				Integrity
					ensuring information remains tamper free and accurate	
				Availibility

	Security Operations Centre

	New business models and technologies increased the need for digital security expertise
	more data being stored

	attacks are becoming more frequent, increased number of APTs
	
	evolving regulations

	numerours defence solutions are availible, often requiring a combination of controls that requires 
	increased expertise to maintain

	why do you need an SOC?

		firewalls and IDS are not enough

		need a nuccleus of all security information

		move from reactive to proactive
			continuous prevention
			protection
			detection
			response capabilities

		coordinate incident response
		increase visibility

	SIM tools

		Security Information Management tools
			aggregate and analyse data intellegently
			provides visulaisation of the cyber environment

		SIM Functionalities
			track and escalate per threat levels
			priority determination
			realtime cross device analsis and aggregation
			audit and compliance
			SIM  needs to be flexible

			SIM tools are not enough, human analysis and decision making still required

	Coursework: do a pentest, blackbox test, given vulnerable machine to test and write up report
	Lab sessions are netkit based [probably time to sort out kali...] 

	explain difference between staeless and statefull

	Firewalls
		impementing some kind of firewall at the edge of the network is essential

		firewalls lead to fortress mentality, becomes sole point of failure
		
		firewalls have their place, but they are most likely going to be relied on less and less [IDS and other such
		solutions are probably more relevant and useful]

		firewall: software that inspects network traffic at the gateway to a network
			
			often running on dedicated hardware
			
			use rules to determine whether packets should be accepted or rejected

			trade network flexability for aditional security [not toatal security, firewalls are often 
			either very flawed or very inconvenient]

		First rules to consider are the business rules; when do you need to let people in?

	[University IP address: 146.227.160.79]
	[Interesting note, geolocated in the middle of the thames... seems familiar, look that up]

	DMZs
		DMZs allow easier internet access for allocated machines; inclusive versus exclusive
		
		Servers in these zones are at greater risk
			use another firewall with a looser set of rules

		Internal network [inc database servers] > Firewall > DMZ (Web, mail, dns etc.) > Firewall > Router

	Specialist: mod_security
		- firewalll for http requests running on webserver
		- protection from range of attacks
		- traffic monitoring and real-time analysis
		- JIT patching
		- DOES HAVE KNOWN WEAKNESSES
	
	Packet Filtering
		- Original firewall software 
		- Reads network and IP layer packet headers
			- Source/Dest. IP addresses
			- Protocol
			- Ports
		- Packet by packet basis

	Stateful inspection
		- Maintains state table with information
		- uses transport layer sequence numbers of datagrams
		- saves substantial amounts of time, rule sets can be extensive and massive
		- initial packet of session checked
			subsequent packets are only checked to see if they are part of the same session once a session
			is trusted
		SYN Sessions
			- sessions are detected using the SYN bit in the datagram
			- existing sessions will timeout, tables will purge
			- common DoS attacks include SYN flooding
	
	Firewall rules
		- firewalls come with default rules, usually inclusive or exclusive
		- there is an order to rules
			- packets are tested in order [kinda cascading?]

		Netfilter
			- framework that provide hooks and interface for tools such as iptables which reside in userspace
			- when a packet comes in over an interface, it is netfilter that is first notified

		[cheap laptops make perfectly servicable firewall machines]


	Tables
		- four different tables attatched to hooks
			- Mangle, nat, filter, raw
	Chains
		- sequences of rules attached to certain kinds of proccessing
		- availible online as packages, not nessecerily trustworthy but can save time and effort
		- each chain has a default policy

	Rules
		- comprised of matches and targets
			- If it matches, what happens?
		- logs are kept per rule:
			- packet counter
			- byte counter
		EG: iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth1 -p tcp --deport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.xxx.xxx

	[Look up packet flow diagrams and examples]

	[check wiki for things like Firewalls, DMZs, packet filtering, stateful inspection, netfilter componants etc.]

	Connection tracking
		allows the kernal to keep track of logical network sessions
		NAT relies on this (?)

	ConnTrack
		Each netfilter connection is uniquely identified by a tuple
		layer 4 key depends on transport protocols
		packets will be mandatorily defragmented

		first packet is new
		the reply is classified establihed
		and ICMP error is related
		and unmatched ICMP error is invalid

		untracked is also an option

		conntack is part of IP Tables, other applications exist with better interfaces

	IDS
		monitors network traffic
		monitors for suspicious/anomalous activity by first establishing a basline level
		may take actions such as blocking users or IP addresses as well as notifying sysadmins
		
		There are many types of IDS

		NIDS
			- Network intrustion detection systems
			- placed at a strategic point or points within the network to monitor traffic to and from
			all devices in the netwrok
			- ideally monitoring all inbound and outbound traffic

		HIDS
			- host intrusion detetion
			- monitors a single host

		Signature Based
			- compare traffic to known signatures

		Passive IDS
			- simply detects and alerts
			- generates alerts for admins who are responsible for dealing with the issue

		Reactive IDS
			- will take pre-defined proactive measures to respond to detected threats
			- typically means blocking traffic from a particular user or IP address
			( can be prone to false positives, and, as a result, pissed off users )

	DarkTrace
		- No rules or signitures
		- machine learning
		- real time threat detection
		- checks inbound and outbound
		- reverse baynesian analysis [?]
		- expensive ($5000 pcm starting price)
		
		[http://www.darktrace.com/technology]

	IPS
		- Like combining an IDS with a firewall
		- an IPS has policies and rules that it compares network traffic to
		- If any traffic violates the policies and rules the IPS can be configured to respond rather than simply
		alerting you

		- NIPS and HIPS (network/host) are availible
		- HIPS probably more effective
		- But dont rely on signatures
			- use anomaly detection
		- create local policies
		- user central reporting and admin
		- can be tricky to configure and "train"

	Snort
		- free flexible NIDS
		- libpcap-based packet sniffer/logger
		- features rules based on logging#
		- can perform content searching/matching in addition to being used to detect a variety
		of other attacks and probes
			-inc buffer overflows and stealth scans

		- works in realtime, generates logs and alerts
		- multiplatform
		- Large knowledge base online
