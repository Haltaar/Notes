	Coursework: do a pentest, blackbox test, given vulnerable machine to test and write up report
	Lab sessions are netkit based [probably time to sort out kali...] 

	explain difference between staeless and statefull

	Firewalls
		impementing some kind of firewall at the edge of the network is essential

		firewalls lead to fortress mentality, becomes sole point of failure
		
		firewalls have their place, but they are most likely going to be relied on less and less [IDS and other such
		solutions are probably more relevant and useful]

		firewall: software that inspects network traffic at the gateway to a network
			
			often running on dedicated hardware
			
			use rules to determine whether packets should be accepted or rejected

			trade network flexability for aditional security [not toatal security, firewalls are often 
			either very flawed or very inconvenient]

		First rules to consider are the business rules; when do you need to let people in?

	[University IP address: 146.227.160.79]
	[Interesting note, geolocated in the middle of the thames... seems familiar, look that up]

	DMZs
		DMZs allow easier internet access for allocated machines; inclusive versus exclusive
		
		Servers in these zones are at greater risk
			use another firewall with a looser set of rules

		Internal network [inc database servers] > Firewall > DMZ (Web, mail, dns etc.) > Firewall > Router

	Specialist: mod_security
		- firewalll for http requests running on webserver
		- protection from range of attacks
		- traffic monitoring and real-time analysis
		- JIT patching
		- DOES HAVE KNOWN WEAKNESSES
	
	Packet Filtering
		- Original firewall software 
		- Reads network and IP layer packet headers
			- Source/Dest. IP addresses
			- Protocol
			- Ports
		- Packet by packet basis

	Stateful inspection
		- Maintains state table with information
		- uses transport layer sequence numbers of datagrams
		- saves substantial amounts of time, rule sets can be extensive and massive
		- initial packet of session checked
			subsequent packets are only checked to see if they are part of the same session once a session
			is trusted
		SYN Sessions
			- sessions are detected using the SYN bit in the datagram
			- existing sessions will timeout, tables will purge
			- common DoS attacks include SYN flooding
	
	Firewall rules
		- firewalls come with default rules, usually inclusive or exclusive
		- there is an order to rules
			- packets are tested in order [kinda cascading?]

		Netfilter
			- framework that provide hooks and interface for tools such as iptables which reside in userspace
			- when a packet comes in over an interface, it is netfilter that is first notified

		[cheap laptops make perfectly servicable firewall machines]


	Tables
		- four different tables attatched to hooks
			- Mangle, nat, filter, raw
	Chains
		- sequences of rules attached to certain kinds of proccessing
		- availible online as packages, not nessecerily trustworthy but can save time and effort
		- each chain has a default policy

	Rules
		- comprised of matches and targets
			- If it matches, what happens?
		- logs are kept per rule:
			- packet counter
			- byte counter
		EG: iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth1 -p tcp --deport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.xxx.xxx

	[Look up packet flow diagrams and examples]

	[check wiki for things like Firewalls, DMZs, packet filtering, stateful inspection, netfilter componants etc.]

	Connection tracking
		allows the kernal to keep track of logical network sessions
		NAT relies on this (?)

	ConnTrack
		Each netfilter connection is uniquely identified by a tuple
		layer 4 key depends on transport protocols
		packets will be mandatorily defragmented

		first packet is new
		the reply is classified establihed
		and ICMP error is related
		and unmatched ICMP error is invalid

		untracked is also an option

		conntack is part of IP Tables, other applications exist with better interfaces

	IDS
		monitors network traffic
		monitors for suspicious/anomalous activity by first establishing a basline level
		may take actions such as blocking users or IP addresses as well as notifying sysadmins
		
		There are many types of IDS

		NIDS
			- Network intrustion detection systems
			- placed at a strategic point or points within the network to monitor traffic to and from
			all devices in the netwrok
			- ideally monitoring all inbound and outbound traffic

		HIDS
			- host intrusion detetion
			- monitors a single host

		Signature Based
			- compare traffic to known signatures

		Passive IDS
			- simply detects and alerts
			- generates alerts for admins who are responsible for dealing with the issue

		Reactive IDS
			- will take pre-defined proactive measures to respond to detected threats
			- typically means blocking traffic from a particular user or IP address
			( can be prone to false positives, and, as a result, pissed off users )

	DarkTrace
		- No rules or signitures
		- machine learning
		- real time threat detection
		- checks inbound and outbound
		- reverse baynesian analysis [?]
		- expensive ($5000 pcm starting price)
		
		[http://www.darktrace.com/technology]

	IPS
		- Like combining an IDS with a firewall
		- an IPS has policies and rules that it compares network traffic to
		- If any traffic violates the policies and rules the IPS can be configured to respond rather than simply
		alerting you

		- NIPS and HIPS (network/host) are availible
		- HIPS probably more effective
		- But dont rely on signatures
			- use anomaly detection
		- create local policies
		- user central reporting and admin
		- can be tricky to configure and "train"

	Snort
		- free flexible NIDS
		- libpcap-based packet sniffer/logger
		- features rules based on logging#
		- can perform content searching/matching in addition to being used to detect a variety
		of other attacks and probes
			-inc buffer overflows and stealth scans

		- works in realtime, generates logs and alerts
		- multiplatform
		- Large knowledge base online

	What is a data logger?
		Software used to record data. Anything can be logged
	Give 6 reasons to perform log analysis

	Distinguish between pattern recognition and machine learning

	compare the features of splink and graylog. Which software would you use with them



	when setting up a security policy, you need to decide what you're going to log and how
	log formats are not straightforward
	you may be dealing with a wide range of information
	eg if analysing an attack on a machine (for example web apps) one may log network traffic

	Pattern recognition
		selecting incoming messages
		compare with pattern book in order to filter or handle different way
		branch of machine learning
			focusses on recognition of regularities in data

	artificial ignorance
		branch of machine learning that is the opposit of filter; deselecting the less than useful bits

		should be a little bit intelligent; anything thats regular or common we ignore, anything novel we log
		if for example a log that shows regular entries then suddenly doesnt then you want to know why

	Application performance management
		emphasis on performance

	Log types and formats

		iptables
		snort
			can create text files, way too slow, takes longer to write entries to log than to actually process
			has alternitive, unified 2, create binary logs
			trouble is you need specialist software to read
			can write straight to database using samba
			can write pcap files for analysis with wireshark
			or can just send emails directly to admin
		apache
		dhcp
		dns
			dhcp and dns should be logged
			file format is propriotary between logging software

		debugging software
			for bug reports, can auto generate changelogs (mantis)

		wireshark
			many advanced features
				filtering by rotocol
				graphical analysis

		RabbitMQ
			messaging system
			client server software
			tunnels messages between multiple platforms

		greylog
			logging client/server software with multiple features
			messaging processing pipeline
			search
			dashboards
				create reports
			graphical analysis
			shows trends for you
			distributed system

		splunk
			business intelegence software
			combines reports from productiveity, security, processing, build them all into graphics that
			essentially assist in running a business

		[if you're going to run a business of any size, you need all the analytics you can get]

		Graphite
			for metrics
		nagios
			for alerts

		[IP tables and snort are super important right now]

    Vulnerability Assesment levels
        
        Scanning
            Using tools such as nmap/zenmap, spidering tools, figure out what is where
        Automated Probes
            Using a tool [scripts] that automatically performs recon (Burp, Zap, Ekinetics). Enter IP and go
        Penetreation Test
            Involves People. Not only can they find existing vulns they can find new ones. Taylor made reports 
            based on the system used 
        Physical Test
            Social Engineering, physical penetration. AFK stuff.


    Black Box vs White Box

        Black Box
            No prior knowledge, blind
            emulates external attacker
        White Box
            Complete knowledge of infrastructure
            Full disclosure
            Emulates inside job
        Grey Box
            Somewhere in between


    Rationale

        A pentest should be carried out on any computer system that is to be deployed in a hostile environment
        before it is deployed. In particular, any internet facing site
        Provides a level of practical assurance that any malicious user will not be able to penetrate the system

    
    Risks

        Invaluable rechnique to any organisations information security program
        White box testing is often done as a fully automated inexpensive process
        Black box penetration testing is labour-intensive - requires expertise to minimise risks
        Testing may slow organisations network's response time
        Systems may be damaged in the course of the testing - use qualified and experianced testers


    Penetration testing execution standards

        PTES  Methodology

            Pre-Engagement
            Intelligence Gathering
            Threat Modelling
            Vulnerability Analysis
            Exploitation
            Post Exploitation
            Reporting
        
            The guide does not provide technical guidlines for executing a pentest
            Need to adapt these for a particular organisation

        NIST
            
            National Institute os Standards and Technology
            Planning Discovery Attack Reporting


    Pentesting - Planning
        
        Rules are identified
        Management approval finalised and documented
        Testing goals are set
        Sets the groundwork for successful penetration test
        No actual testing occurs in this phase

    Pentesting - Discovery

        Two parts
            Start of actual testing
                Information gathering and scanning
                Network port and service identification
        
        Information Gathering
            Host name / IP information
            employee names and contact information
            system information such as names and shares
            application and service information
            dumpster diving
            physical walkthroughs of facilities
            may also uncover additional information to be used during the penetration test (passwords written 
            on paper

        Vulnerability Analysis
            Involves comparing the services, applications and operating systems of scanned hosts against 
            vulnerability databases
                Process that is automatic for vulnerability scanners
                Testers own knowledge of vulnerabilities

    Pentesting - Attack

        Gaining access, Escalating Privileges, System Browsing, Install additional tools (repeat)

        Exploits discovered vulnerabilities to confirm their existence

        Heart of any pentest
        
        Successful attack verifies vulnerabilities
            safeguards identified to mitigate associated security exposure
        
        In many cases, exploits tat are executed do not grant the maximum level of potential access to an attacker
        
        May instead result in the testers learning more about the targeted network and its potential 
        vulnerabilities or induce change in the state of the targeted networks security
        
        Some exploits enable testers to escalate their privileges on the system or network to gain access to 
        additional resources
