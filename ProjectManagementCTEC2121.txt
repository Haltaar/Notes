	hard copy to FOTAC, digital copy to turnitin
	
	Marking scheme to be posted
	
	doccumenting progress not nessesary, but suggested. Blogs, journals etc.
	Gantt chart?

	NO PLAGURISM!!!1!

	questionaire expected

	1000 words per student expected 
	
	TOPIC - VR:
		Possible applications(Gaming, medical, simulation, design etc.)
		Cost effectiveness per application
		General opinion questionaire

	Compare between nations for any given topic?

	What is research?
		Systematic investigation into the study of a field
		Discover new facts, collate old facts
		
		Start with a question or problem to solve (Hypothesis)
			Usually involves manipulation of independant variables to bring about changes in 
			dependant variables
			Problem/Question must be specific
			vaugity leads to unfocussed work

		Answers may seem obvious, but even an obvious point is worth proving
		Problem must be submitted to rigourous scientific scrutiny, else only guesses remain
		Don't assume common sense/common knowledge
		Don't assume, period

	Negative resulults still valuable
	Specifics and details EXTREMELY important

		
	1 - Statement of problem
	2 - Literature Review
	3 - Choice of research Method
	4 - Design Study
	5 - Data Collection
	6 - Analysis of data
	7 - Write Up

	Make notes of sources. Biblography is important, details of sources are nessesary

	Bias is inherant to most studies; acknowledge where bias may occur and account for it in your conclusion.
	Even an inconclusive study is a valid one.

	Write abstract last, put it first

	the first thing the examiners look at is the title, abstract, then references! References are super important.
	Ensure a wide variety of credible resources as it is important for first impressions

	literiture review can be main method of chosen methodology. Subhead different sections to improve clarity
	when large amounts of litterature are being referenced

	Review articles/Meta analysis are very useful, look out for them

	example annoteded research paper availible on blackboard

	VR Notes:
		Historical
			http://www.vrs.org.uk/virtual-reality/history.html
				1838 - Stereoscopic Photos/Viewers
				1929 - First Flight Sim
					Link Trainer
					Edward link
					entirely electromechanical
					used during WWII by 500000 pilots
				1930s - VR Predicted in SciFi
					Pygmalion's Spectacles - Stanley G. Weinbaum
				1950s - Morton Heilig's Sensorama
				1960 - First head mounted display - Teleshpere Mask
				1965 - Ivan Sutherland describes "The Ultimate Display"
					HMD used to achieve maximum immersion
					computer hardware used to maintain virtual world
					ability to interact with virtual objects in a realistic manner
				1968 - Sword of Damocles - First HMD connected to a computer rather than a camera
					Suspended from the cieling
					primitive wireframe graphics
				1969 - Myron Kruegere's Artificial Reality
				1987 - 'Virtual Reality' coined as a term
					Jaron Lanier founded the Visual Programming Lab (VPL)
					Developed dataglove along with Tom Zimmerman
					Developed the EyePhone HMD
					First production vr goggles (EyePhone 1, $9400, EyePhone HRX, $49000)
					Major developments into haptics, developed gloves ($9000)
				1991 - Virtuality Group Arcade machines
					large arcade machines allowed first real public access to VR
					realtime CG Visuals (Less than 50ms latency)
					Networked multi-player
				1992 - The Lawnmower Man movie
					wide audiance introduced to the concept of VR
					drew inspiration from VPL and Jaron Lanier
				1993 - SEGA VR Headset announced

	ontology
		realism vs relativism
			[look this up]
	
	Epistemology
		Positivism or Realism
			observer independent
			explaining
			empirical

			Quantitative
			Objective 
			Questions
				what? when? how much?
			deductive
			[fact based]

		Interperativism or Constructionism
			observer dependednt
			understanding
			hermeneutic
				interperating texts and comunications [neat!]

			Subjective
			Qualitative
			Questions
				Why? How?
			Discover meaning
			context, social element
			inductive
			[people rather than facts]

		Pragmatism
			balanced approach
			results focussed
			questions
				who? what? when? where? why? how?
			deductive and inductive


	The scientific method
		Question > Research > Hypothesis > Experiment > Analysis > Results

	Quantitative
		Questionairs, experiments
		numbers, unbiased facts, totally objective 
		deductive ( General > specific, top down)
			Using large sampes of general facts to make specific conclusions
	Inductive
		Interviews, narrative, observations, ethnography [?]
		open ended questions, subjective
		can be biased [!]
		inductive (Specific > general, bottom up)
			generalising from specific instances
	
	methods
		feasability study (is it possible?)

		comparitative study (is it better?)

		observational study (what is it?)
			Study system use/performance
			User testing, AB testing, UX feedback
			usability, accessability

		literature survey (what is known about it?)
			[lots of reading!]

		formal method (abstration)
			logic, math, algorithms, complexity, proofs
			Specification, verification
			model checking, theorem proving

		simulation (what if?)
			real world phenomenon > abstract computer simulations
			constants, variables, rules, probabilities
				weather prediction, flocking
		
		Experimentation/implementation
			testing for correctness
			evaluating any given system
			parameters, input > process > output (IPO)
			prototyping

	Analysing Data
		How many results?
		Where from?
		How did you get them? (Digital, paper etc.
		When did you get them?
		
		These things need describing as part of the methodology section of the paper
		Create a spreadsheet/table of results
