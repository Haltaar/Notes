[PHP feels like C, written by C devs, in C]

    Data Structures
        Storing data for use and reuse

    Outputting text

        Echo and print
            
            Single echo statement
                
            Print & print_r

            var_dump($data [,true])

    [php.net, home of all things php]

    Operators
        
        Same as in C or other C like languages

        Arithmetic
            + - / * %

        Bitwise
            & | ^ << >>

        Comparison
            < > == != <= >= <=> === !==

                (===/!== is type equality)

        Error Control
            @

        Execution Operators
            `

        Increment/Decrement
            ++ --

        Logical Operators
            && || and or

        String Operators
            . .=

        Array Operators
            + == === != <> !==

        Types Operators
            instanceof


    Data Types
        
        Four scalar types
            Boolean
            Integer
            Float
            String

        Two compound types
            Array
            Object

        Two special types
            resource
            NULL


    Variables
        Weakly Typed
        Case sensitive


        Assign by reference

            $foo = 'bob';
            $bar = &$foo;
            $bar = 'alice;
            # $foo is changed to alice also
    

    Arrays

        Elements in arrays don't exist until created.

        $array = [];
        $array[1] = foo;
        $array[3] = bar;

        here, $array[2] does not exist and attempts to access it (such as a for loop) will result in fatal error

        Array elements can be named, and elements of differing types can coexist in the same array

        unset() removes an element. That element no longer exists as described above


    If ... then... elseif... else
        More or less the same as C


    Switch
        More or less the same as C


    For
        Identical to C


    foreach()
        used to trasvers arrays with elements missing

            foreach (array_expression as $value)
            
                statement

            foreach (array_expression as $key => $value)

                statement


    while()
        same as C


    do_while()

        do {
            statement;
        } while (condition);


    goto
        don't
