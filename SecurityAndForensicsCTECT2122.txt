	directory entries contain inodes, inodes contain metadata/atributes, 10 blocks of data
		if file data is less that 10k, data is stored with the inode
			past that limit, files are stored in indirect blocks

			past 256k, a double indirect block is used
				double indirect blocks are pointers to single indirect blocks (which are 256k each)
			tripple indirect blocks point to 256 double indirect blocks

	FAT filesystems are singular linked lists (causes framentation, size limits)

	linux can mount multiple filesystems under different directories [which is awesome]

	[read filesystem man pages and fstab man page]
	translation lookaside buffers (TLBs) [Look this one up]

	cold boot attack - dumping memory whilst machine is powered off

	Current processes?
		sudo ps aux
	network services
		sudo lsof -i | grep LISTEN
	Netcoms
		sudo netstat -pn -l

	package management

		[apt has super cow powers]
		apt-get
		apt-cache
		apt-file	[man all of these]
		dpkg

	.deb files

		primitive archive file format
	
		contains
			debian-binary
				tells the package manager what version of the package manager to use
				allows for backwards compatability
			control.tar.gz
				contains control file
					contains package information including dependencies
					may also include recommends, suggests, conflicts, replaces, breaks, and provides
				md5sums
				{pre,post}{inst,rm}
					scripts for before and after intallation and removal
			data.tar.gz
				compressed installation files

		CD-ROMs are trusted without any GPG verification

	protect BIOS
	protect Bootloader
	partition sensibly
	encrypt swap space
	monitor for open ports and connections
	minimize running services
	check integrety of packages
	check integrety of pakage manager!

	IPTables
		port knocking (port security through obscurity)
			client must 'knock' on a series of ports in order to open a particular port (eg SSH)

		Rate Limiting
			limit amount of packets to mitigate D/DOS

	RECAP:
		Reduce services by either:
			Switching off services using the init system
			removing services using the package manager
		Protect Services by:
			chroot jails
			Linux cgroups
		Protect the network services by
			Netfilter (iptables)
			tcpwrappers
			fail2ban
	
	chmod changes the mode field in the inode data structure for a given file or directory

	permissions lists
		the traditional unix solution assumes multiple owners but a limited security requirement
		it associates with each file
		a fixed owner domain
			user || group || others
		a fixed capability list
			read || write || search/execute

	user (u) + group(g) + other(o)
	r w x	   r w x      r w x

	owner of a file can change permission with chmod command
		chmod go-rw bar.h
		chmod 755 bar.h (7=111=rwx, 5=101=r-x)
	
	can be specified (recursively) at any level
		chmod -R go+rx barDirectory
	
	Special permissions
		sticky bit (1xxx) 		> ignored on later linux kernals. Designed to store .text segment in swap.
		Restricted deletion (1xxx)	> directory flag. Only owners of directory, or file ( + root) can delete items
		[complete later]

	chattr > Tool to change extended attributes
	lsattr > Tool to read extended attributes

	access control lists logic

	if
		the user ID of the process is the owner, the owner entry determins access
	else if
		the user ID of the process matches the qualifier in one of the named user entries, this entry determines access
	else if
		one of the group IDs of the proccess matches the owning group, and the owning group entry contains the
		requested permissions, this entry determines access
	else if
		one of the group IDs of the process matches the ualifier of one of the named group entries and this entry
		contains the requested permissions, this entry determines access
	else if
		one of the group IDs of the process matches the owning group or any of the named group entriesm
		but niether the owning group entry nor any f the mathing named group entries [complete later]

	24th Jan deadline for coursework

	set up a deliberatly vulnerable system or find a vulnerability in an existing system, then develop a remediation
	strategy 

	develop a video demonstration [in the style of a defcon talk] for the exploit and the fix

	video equipment is availible from the av loans system

	produce a report

	3 stages

	stage 1: 0%  - 50% marks availible
		find an exploit, build a system, write report that discusses the vuln and why its there, 
		and the exploit and how it works

	stage 2: 50% - 70% marks availible
		stage 1 plus design a remediation strategy that will either reduce the likelyhood of the exploit working as
		designed, or trigger an alarm when it occurs. Produce report detailing reasoning for approah and explaining how 
		the fix works
		
	stage 3: 70% - 100% marks availible
		implement the 

	marks acieved via correctness, clarity and style; report should be concise, needs to be understandable to a 
	technical audiance with appropriet level of detail with minimum chances for misunderstanding, quality of the
	solution

	file system integrity checking
	
	we have a baseline of the system, based on our trusted installation. Carefully consider the monitoring of 
	files to determine if they have changed without your proir knowledge

	intrusion detection systems
		integreit
		aide
		tripwire
	
	or a homegrown solution which would begin by taking a baseline analysis, storing securely for later review. Test
	against this regularly

	consider an offline integrity check

	cron

	user customisable executable scripts inside the following directories will run at the frequency as the name suggests:
		/etc/cron.daily
		/etc/cron.houly
		/etc/cron.weekly
		/etc/cron.monthly

	There may also be many cron tables, or crontab files
		system wide > /etc/crontab
		Individual Users > /var/spool/cron/crontables/{username}
	user crontab must be pushed through crontab(1)

	examples

	#run the 'something' command every hour on the hour
	0	*	*	*	* /sbin/something

	procfs

	the /proc filesystem is a special filesystem in UNIX and UNIX like OSes that presents information about processes in
	a hierarchical filesystem.

	In Linux, this filesystem is extended to include some non-process related data

	files stored in the /proc filesystem are views of internal kernal structures

		/proc/{pid}	>	Information about individual running processes
		/proc/sys	>	dynamically configurable runtime kernal parameters

	[processes have PID (their own ID) and PPID (their parents identity)]

	[/proc/{pid}/mem is a representation of a processes current memory space. You can DD this file!]

	reliable software does what its supposed to do
	secure software does what its supposed to to and nothing more

	solution: only ever use secure software

	Figuring out the solution: 
		
		look at the source code of every piece of software that you use
			Highly impractical

		Interfere with the kernel to create a custom solution to create a highly secure environment for your
		software to run in
			High maintainence and difficult to build

		Or we can try something more simple and abstract

	Security Issues
		
		1) Must not be possible to bypass the hose intrusion prevention systems
			use linux kernal security modules
			highest quality security mediation
		
		2) Misuse prevention
			easy to manage
			harder to secure
			blacklist mechanism

		3) anomaly prevention
			harder to manage
			easier to secure
			whitelist mechanism
	AppAromor

		AppArmor is designed to allow simpler anomaly prevention
			- the focus is on application security
			- name based access controls to simplify management
			- hybrid whitelist/blacklist approach

		Whenever a program runs, protected by AppArmor (Regardless of UID), AppArmor will control:
			- The POSIX capabilities (even when running UID 0)
			- The directories and file access controls
		
	(setuid sets the user id that the proccess is running as. setgid for group id)

	Apparmor compliments traditioninal unix permissions. Apps must have read/write/execute permissions before these
	can be augmented with greater granularity by apparmor

	[Tools: XRY, Encase, FTK imager/FTK, Autopsy, X-ways, win-hex]

	[Reading: Nelson, B. et al Guide to Computer Forensics and Investigations 4th ed, Jones, K. et al Real Digital 
	Forensics, Carvey, H. Windows Forensics and incident recovery]



	Digital forensics requires a systematic approach (nelson et al.)

		make an initial asssessment about the type of case you are involved in

		determine the approach to be taken

		create a detailed design

		identify the resources needed

		obtain and copy an evidence disk(s)

		Identify the risks (risk assessment)

		Manage the risk

		test your design

		analyse/recover the digital evidence

		apply evidence to the case

		write the case report

		critique the investigation

	"CF specialists follow clear well-defined methodologies and procedures"

		Document everything

		be reasonable
		
		"Do no harm"

		Maintain chain of custody

		use the correct standards and toolkits

	Learn and apply the UK ACPO

		1 Change nothing

		2 if there is the risk of changing something, know what you are doing

		3 document everything

		4 there is always someone to blame

	Software
		cannot rely on utilities on suspect machine
		need specialist software created to support forensic investigations

	Hardware
		forensic toolkits/labs include workstations, tape devices, cameras etc.

                                        victim to victim
        cyberstalking                   using computer systems to obtain excessive/intrusive amounts of 
                                        information about a person, analogous to stalking in person, 
                                        only in cyber terms

        Copyright Piracy                uploading copyrighted material owned by someone else, often for 
                                        free

    What is computer forensics?
        
        The scientific examination and analysis of data held on, or retrieved from, computer systems or
        electronic hardware and storage media in order to provide evidence to support a case, civil or 
        criminal

    Assurances of the Forensic Expert
        
        No possible evidence is damaged, destroyed, or compromised by the forensics procedures used to 
        investigate the computer (Preservation of evidence)
        
        No possible computer malware is introduced to the computer being investigated during the 
        analysis process (Prevent Contamination of evidence)
        
        Any extrancted and possibly relevant evidence is properly handled and protected from 
        damage (Extraction and Preservation of evidence)
        
        A complete documentation of the investigation procedure (Accountability of the evidence)
        
        Ensuring minimum interference with the normal life of the organisation
        
        Details of the client-attornet relationship are not disclosed in order to maintain professional 
        ethics and legality (Ethics of investigation)

    Digital Evidece
        Any information of probative value which is stored or transmitted in digital form
            In court terms
                Evidence is factual proof of what did and did not happen
        All crime (including cyber crime) can leave evidence
